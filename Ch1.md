# Finding Sarasvati 
### By Varun Vasudevan

The earliest civilizations established, lived and prospered along mighty rivers - Nile, Indus, Amazon to name a few. Once the hunter and gatherers began to consolidate the need for a perennial source of water came to prominence, thus began the cradle for knowledge.

One such river is mentioned many times in vedic texts - Sarasvati - the mother of knowledge.
Goddess Sarasvati is revered and prayed as the supreme being for knowledge across the Indian Subcontinent. While Sarasvati in recent times is either considered as a Goddess or a river which exists in its metaphysical form - the Triveni along with Ganga and Yamuna. 
However there is a small section of the followers of the great Sarasvati who feel and think of it as a river which used to flow previously but has now dried up. 

The reference of the river in older vedic texts especially compels us with the theory that Sarasvati may have been a real river and quite possibly could have been the source from where vedas were compiled for the very first time. This doesn’t seem too far-fetched given the fact that the Goddess is considered the source for knowledge, and Vedas too are considered the source of knowledge in Sanatan Dharma.

Just for a moment consider Sarasvati was a real river we shall try and narrow down its real location with the clues we have at our disposal.  By the time Sarasvati was mentioned in Mahabharata it had already dried up into a desert which was trodden by Balarama. So we are already talking about a time which spans a few yugas (I’ll do a followup on the ancient measurement of time). We are at the very least looking back a few thousand years. Vedas were initially composed as poems, it wasn’t written down until a very long time, presence of language is not dismissed while scripts were developed a very long time afterwards. Vedas are the earliest known religious texts, the word literally means knowledge ranging from philosophy, ethics, medicine, maths, astrology and magic. There are four Vedas - Rig, Sama, Yajur, Atharvana stated per the chronology. 

Manu the progenitor (hence the word Manav) escaped the great flood and paved the way for the birth of vedas. Mentioned in the NadiStuti (ode to rivers), which gives us the first clue for the river to be actual (what is the point in mentioning a superficial river along with the actual ones - unless the entirety is a fantasy). The description of the river in Rig Veda (the oldest of the vedas) is drastically different from the description and reference in the subsequent vedas, which suggests migration (quite possibly due to a flood - which matches with the story that Manu was escaped a great flood). The natural recourse for a community frequently affected by the ferocity of a river, inundating their lands and farms is to move to a river which is passive. A passive river which is rain fed (seasonal rivers are less likely to be ferocious and more likely to dry up due to micro-weather changes).

There is a river mentioned in Avesta called Haraxvati which could have been the initial river Sarasvati, and later because of flooding the society might have moved east bound into the divine land between Indus and the later Sarasvati - which now is being associated with Ghaggar Hakra river system, which dried up and subsequently got lost in the Thar desert. This very piece of land could have been the place were the ancient texts were composed and spread across the country.
