# World's First Mark & Sweep Algorithm
### By Varun Vasudevan

Legend goes that Krishna took a pulse before the great battle of Mahabharat and asked various warriors
from either sides as to how much time they would take to finish the war.
Greatest of warriors of the likes of Arjuna, Karna, Bhishma, Duryodhana gave an estimate of 15-20 days.
When the same same question was asked to Barbarika he replied it would take him a second to finish everything.
He had a boon of 3 arrows from Lord Shiva using which he can finish the battle in matter of few seconds.
The first arrow would mark all the things he wanted to destroy, the second arrow would mark all the things he wanted to save
and the third would destroy all things marked for destruction.
Krishna realised his power, he knew whichever side Barbarika choose to participate would win,
thus asked his head in charity which Barbarika happily accepted and watched the entire battle as a mere spectator.
His act of humility made him one of the greatest warrior.
